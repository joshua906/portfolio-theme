					<h3>A complicated app with a simple solution</h3>
					<p>The wish list desired by our client was long, and if executed would lead to a mobilized web version of their current website. This isn’t in the best interest of the client. Instead, this would create a case users wouldn’t feel a need to download an app since it’s an exact replica of their current website. This will result in a waste of time and money for our client.</p>
					<p>So Instead, we chose to primarily focus our attention on a few of the requirements that would be most beneficial for the students in the long haul. The app would give students of different grade levels (8th grade - Senior) a checklist that listed the necessary steps one would have to take to ensure college readiness. </p>

					<h3>Creating the App's User Interface</h3>
					<p>Before beginning the apps interface, a flow chart was created. The flow chart was utilized to help establish the necessary steps one would need to take to complete each task. Our solution gives the users an easy and efficient way to progress towards college readiness. This process highlighted our need for a clean interface that created an intuitive flow between the different views for the user.</p>

					<p>Rough sketches and Wireframes were then created to help us further visualize the layout of the app. The app went through many different iterations but through the process we could distinguish a design direction that matched the goals we were trying to accomplish.</p>
					<p>This lead to the process of assembling our prototype. To do this, we started with low fidelity mockups that allowed us to begin seeing how our application would take form. Once we were confident in the ease of use our layout provided the additions of icons, color, and imagery were added to aid the user in completing their task within the app.</p>

					<h3>Exploring the New Marketing Strategy</h3>
					<p>Marketing within the non-profit sector poses its own challenges. Often times, companies are more
						focused on their message that visually the design of their marketing attempts feel neglected. With this
						in mind, we set out to create a website that was primarily focused on content, but engaged our
						audience through a modern and clean aesthetic.</p>
					<p>Since non-profits have a limited budget, we wanted to ensure our marketing strategy would resonate
					with our audience. To best accomplish this we felt it necessary to stay away from the strong corporate
					appearance and tone for the site. In doing so, a deeper connection would be created with our audience
					by providing a more personal experience, which would lead to an increase in sales.</p>

					<h3>The Design Process & Solution</h3>
					<p>The next challenge was to find the best way that promoted our content within the website. Since we
					identified early on in the process that we wanted to try a different approach to reach our audience, I
					knew I had a chance to try something different. </p>

					<p>During the wire framing and exploration stage the layout of our website was established. Throughout
						this process my drafts and sketches lead me to a simplified layout that enhances the user’s experience
						but allows our content to shine. With a minimalist approach, this forced us to focus on elements that
						best supported our campaign, and strip away the unnecessary items that might cause distractions. </p>
					
					
					<p>Once the initial wireframes were completed, the development of the site began. In this stage I created
					the visuals to be implemented within our microsite. The visuals consisted of bold typography and imagery
					from the medical and technology field. </p>

					<h3>Project Background & Challenges</h3>
					<p>Before starting on the design for the project, my first and primary goal was to develop a strategy that
					would help the brand effectively reach its targeted audience. Since the site was developed in the
					pre-responsive era, the visuals and layout seemed outdated and didn’t provide his users with a smooth
					experience they would be accustomed to seeing. Therefore, a priority was placed on optimizing his new
					site for the various screen sizes used today to improve the sites functionality. </p>
					<p><b>Our Main goals for the site were quite simple:</b></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Providing an improved use of functionality</li>
						<li>Enhance the visual appeal of the site</li>
						<li>Build the site so it is easy to maintain and update (Using WordPress as CMS)</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Design and Development Strategy</h3>
					<p>As I approached the design and development phase, my primary focus was directed toward the users
					experience and making it as intuitive as possible. It was clear from the start that his targeted audiences
					were visual learners and needed more than great content to keep their attention. So it was key to create
					a visually engaging experience that kept the focus on the videos as one journeyed throughout the site.

					<h3>Sketches and Wireframes</h3>
					<p>To accomplish this, my sketches and wireframes consisted of different layouts that made the videos
the focal point of the site while the text and imagery faded into the background. Instead of using a static
hero image as the first visual someone sees as they enter the site, a video header background was
						added. This implementation encouraged the user to discover more within the site. </p>

					<h3>Prototyping and Outcome</h3>
					<p>I felt it was necessary to create a small prototype of the home page. This way we could get an accurate
representation of how a user might interact with the website and what features may need to be added

					<p>For example, we reduced the amount of videos that were featured on the homepage which increased
load time, and improved the users experience. We also moved the video header from the current
front page and made it its own separate page. We felt that the video demands its own attention and
should be used as an interactive element for people visiting the site.
					</p>
					
					<p>The outcome of the site now features improved functionality across all devices and offers viewers a
						unique easy to navigate experience. </p>
